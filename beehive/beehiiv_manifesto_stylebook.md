# From Design Systems to AI Systems

Twenty years teaching pixels where to go. Now teaching AI not to be an idiot. The transition taught me one thing: we've forgotten everything that matters.

## Weight Matters

In design, we count kilobytes. A 200ms delay feels broken. We optimize images, compress JavaScript, fight for every millisecond.

In AI, we install 551MB to make API calls. 

That's not progress. That's amnesia.

## The Designer's Disease

We have this disease. We ask annoying questions:
- Why does this exist?
- What problem does it solve?
- Could we solve it simpler?

Applied to AI frameworks, the answers hurt:

Dependencies that exist "just in case."
Abstractions making simple things complex.
Frameworks on frameworks on frameworks.

Like those Russian dolls, except each one is fatter and nobody remembers what's in the middle.

## Real Numbers from Real Pain

```
My laptop: Screaming
CrewAI: 551.5MB
Import time: 3.268 seconds
My sanity: Decreasing
```

Three seconds to import. I've shipped entire products that load faster.

For context: Windows 95 was 40MB. This chat framework needs 14 times that. To send text to an API.

## What Design Taught Me About AI

**Constraints create clarity.** Can't throw compute at it? Actually solve it.

**Performance is invisible until it isn't.** Users don't notice fast. They notice slow. Those 3 seconds multiply.

**Abstractions should simplify.** If you need a PhD to understand your chatbot's dependencies, you've failed.

**The best code is deleted code.** The best dependency is no dependency.

## The Minimalist in Maximalist Times

Everyone's adding. Nobody's removing.

"It works" beats "it works well."

Complexity mistaken for capability.

We built the wrong culture.

## Why This Matters

We're not building toys. We're building infrastructure for the next decade of human-computer interaction.

Every bad decision compounds. Every unnecessary abstraction becomes tomorrow's technical debt. Every bloated framework becomes the standard everyone copies.

Want an AI future that feels like enterprise Java 2010? Keep going.

Want one that feels fast, intuitive, almost magical? Start giving a shit about megabytes.

## What Actually Works

Question before importing.
Measure before shipping.
Simplify before scaling.
Design before developing.

Not sexy. Not revolutionary. Just what we learned twenty years ago and somehow forgot.

## The Bridge

The future needs builders who remember:
- Every millisecond has a cost
- Every dependency is a decision
- Every abstraction is a bet
- Every line of code is a liability

We need people who've spent years making things beautiful AND fast. Who know that true innovation isn't adding moreâ€”it's achieving more with less.

Design thinking isn't about pretty interfaces. It's about giving a damn.

**Vector Wave**: Where we remember that performance is a feature. Where 551MB for a chatbot hurts our soul. Where the future is built by people who measure twice and import once.

The machines are learning. Let's teach them restraint.
