# I Made AI Simulate Netflix Executives. They All Picked The Same Show

**TL;DR:** I generated 180 episodes worth of sci-fi storylines, then asked AI to simulate a summit of streaming executives evaluating them. The result? Both the "executives" and my algorithm picked the same winner. But the real story is what broke along the way.

## The Experiment: When AI Meets Hollywood

I spent two decades in design. Then I decided to see if AI could think like a Hollywood executive.

The setup was simple: Create a noir sci-fi series called "Glitch Noir" set in Ouroboros City—a time-loop megacity where a detective hunts the algorithm murdering time itself. But instead of one storyline, I generated 10 complete multi-season arcs:

- **"Memory Exchange"** - Financial thriller where memories trade like stocks
- **"Meat and Code"** - Body horror where servers run on human neural tissue  
- **"Revolution in the Loop"** - Class warfare with temporal guerrilla tactics
- **"The Void Stares Back"** - Nihilistic noir about the end of meaning

Each arc: 3 seasons, 6 episodes per season. **180 potential episodes total.**

Traditional approach? Months in a writers' room. With AI? Every weird idea explored in days.

## The Summit: AI CEOs in Action

Instead of choosing myself, I asked AI to simulate key streaming executives evaluating these storylines. The cast:

- Ted Sarandos (Netflix)
- Jennifer Salke (Amazon Studios)
- Casey Bloys (HBO)
- Zack Van Amburg (Apple TV+)

The AI studied their public statements and platform strategies. The simulation was uncannily accurate:

**Casey Bloys (HBO):** "Can AI-generated content keep pace with 'Succession' or 'The Last of Us'?"

**Jennifer Salke (Amazon):** "I'm looking at 'Revolution in the Loop'—it's 'The Boys' meets 'Black Mirror'."

**Zack Van Amburg (Apple):** "'Meat and Code' with its meta-narrative... that's ambitious."

The debate was fierce. HBO wanted prestige. Amazon pushed for global appeal. Apple championed innovation.

But they converged on **"Memory Exchange"**—the financial thriller about trading memories.

**Casey Bloys:** "I hate to admit it, but it's fucking brilliant. HBO could do this."

Final consensus score: **95/100**

## The Algorithm: PRISM-X

I also built an algorithmic evaluation system analyzing:

- Genre demand trends
- Cultural alignment (US, Asia, Europe, LATAM)
- Monte Carlo risk assessment (10,000 simulations)
- Viral mechanics potential

The algorithm's pick? Also "Memory Exchange" with a score of **94/100**.

Humans and machines agreed. That never happens.

## The Reality Check: When Theory Meets Practice

Here's what nobody tells you about AI video production:

### Problem #1: The Fedora Obsession

MiniMax and Hailuo (cutting-edge video generators) kept adding a 1940s detective fedora to my cyberpunk character. My prompts said:
- "Tactical armor"
- "Neural implants"  
- "NO VINTAGE CLOTHING"

AI's response? Here's your detective with a fedora.

I tried everything:
- "NO HAT, PURE CYBERPUNK"
- "BARE HEAD showing short grey hair"
- "NO FUCKING VINTAGE AESTHETIC"

Still got fedoras. Solution? Generate 3x more videos and cherry-pick the hatless ones.

### Problem #2: Lip Sync Hates Style

Wav2Lip works great on photorealistic video. Feed it our glitch-noir aesthetic? Complete breakdown.

Why? Wav2Lip needs clear facial landmarks. Our glitch effects = no landmarks. Result: lips moving randomly or not at all.

### Problem #3: The Pipeline Evolution

**Initial Vision:** Local everything
- LLaMA 2 → Local video gen → Local post-processing
- Cost: $0, Quality: Terrible

**Reality Check:** Hybrid approach  
- Local LLM → MiniMax API → Local post-processing
- Cost: ~$50, Quality: Better

**Current Setup:** Cloud-first
- Claude Opus 4 → MiniMax API → Selective local processing
- Cost: $0.19/screenplay + video costs, Quality: Actually usable

Key learning: **My RTX 4070 Ti with 16GB VRAM couldn't match cloud quality.** Sometimes paying works.

## The Results That Matter

- Story variations explored: **10 complete arcs**
- Episode concepts: **180**
- Generation time: **52 seconds per screenplay**
- Cost per screenplay: **$0.19**
- MiniMax credits burned: **~1200**
- Confidence in final choice: **94%**

## What This Actually Means

We're entering an era where creativity isn't limited by time or resources—only by imagination and the ability to evaluate options.

The real breakthrough isn't generating content. It's being able to:
1. Explore every creative direction simultaneously
2. Simulate stakeholder reactions before pitching
3. Apply data science to artistic decisions
4. Learn from failures at 363x speed

This isn't AI replacing writers. It's design thinking applied to AI applied to entertainment.

**The wrong question:** "Will AI replace human creativity?"

**The right question:** "What becomes possible when we can explore every creative path?"
