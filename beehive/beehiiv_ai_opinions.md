# AI Has Opinions Nobody Asked For

My AI insists detectives wear fedoras in 2087. That's not even the weirdest part.

## The Fedora Incident

Building a cyberpunk series. Year 2087. Detective in neural implants and tactical gear.

AI: "Here's your detective in a 1940s fedora."

Me: "No vintage clothing. Cyberpunk. Future."

AI: "Fedora it is."

Twenty-three attempts later, still fedoras. Like it physically cannot imagine a detective without one.

## The Coffee Shop Syndrome

Asked AI to generate "modern workspace."

Results:
- MacBook: ✓
- Minimalist desk: ✓  
- Succulent: ✓
- Exposed brick wall: Always
- Edison bulbs: ALWAYS

Prompt: "Corporate office, no exposed brick"
AI: "Best I can do is painted brick"

It's convinced every workspace needs industrial chic. Even when I specifically ask for cubicles.

## The Smile Problem

Generate professional headshots. Every single person:
- Smiling
- Perfect teeth
- Head tilted exactly 15 degrees right
- Looking slightly past camera

"Serious expression, looking directly at camera"
Result: Smiling, head tilted, looking past camera.

"ANGRY person staring STRAIGHT at lens"
Result: Slightly less smiling, same head tilt.

AI thinks everyone's in a toothpaste commercial.

## The Purple Sunset Conspiracy

Background for any outdoor scene:
- Purple/orange sunset: 89% of the time
- Golden hour: 10%
- Actual daylight: 1%

"Harsh midday sun"
AI: Here's your purple sunset

"Overcast grey sky"  
AI: Purple sunset with clouds

"PITCH BLACK NIGHT"
AI: Purple sunset but darker

## The Hand Situation

```
Attempt #1: Generate person → 7 fingers
Attempt #2: "Five fingers only" → 3 fingers
Attempt #3: "NORMAL HUMAN HANDS" → Hands hidden
Attempt #4: "Show hands" → Tentacles
Attempt #5: Give up → Perfect hands
```

AI knows hands are its weakness. Sometimes it just hides them. Sometimes it panics and adds extras.

## The Name Game

Ask AI to name a character:

Female CEO: Always Sarah Chen or Jessica Williams
Male developer: Always Alex Kumar or David Park  
Startup: Always "NexGen" something
AI company: Must contain "Mind", "Neural", or "Synth"

"Give me an unusual name"
AI: "How about... Alexandra Kumar?"

## The Food Prejudice

Restaurant scene:
- Always serves pasta or steak
- Wine glasses everywhere
- Candles (even at lunch)
- That one fancy dessert with raspberry drizzle

"Fast food restaurant"
AI: Pasta in a fancier container

"Street food"
AI: Pasta but you're standing

## Why This Matters (Or Doesn't)

These aren't bugs. They're biases. AI learned from millions of images where:
- Detectives have fedoras
- Workspaces have exposed brick
- People smile in photos
- Sunsets are purple

It's like AI went to art school and only remembered the clichés.

## Working With Opinionated AI

```
Fighting it: 23 attempts, still wrong
Working with it: Hide the fedora in post
Embracing it: "Detective Fedora" is now a character
```

Sometimes the AI's weird preferences make things better. Sometimes they make you question reality.

But they always make you generate three times more content than planned.
