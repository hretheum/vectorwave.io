# From Design Systems to AI Systems

Twenty years of pushing pixels. Now pushing chatbots around. The difference? Chatbots are 14 times heavier than Windows 95.

## The 551MB Wake-Up Call

My laptop fan sounds like it's trying to achieve liftoff. Check task manager. Python package using more memory than Photoshop.

CrewAI. "Production-ready" AI framework. 551.5MB of dependencies to make API calls.

Windows 95 was 40MB. This chatbot framework is 14 Windows 95s. To send text to OpenAI.

## What Designers Do (That AI Devs Forgot)

In design, 200ms feels broken. We compress images, fight for every kilobyte, measure everything.

In AI? pip install half-a-gigabyte. Wait three seconds for imports. Ship it.

```
Real numbers from my laptop:
CrewAI: 551.5MB
Import time: 3.268 seconds  
Memory overhead: 208MB
My faith in humanity: 404
```

Three seconds to import. I've built entire landing pages that load faster than this framework initializes.

## The Dependency Disaster

Mapped the dependency tree. 175 packages. For what? To orchestrate API calls.

Found telemetry sending data to their servers. Opt-out, naturally. Found packages that exist "just in case." Found abstractions wrapping abstractions wrapping a simple HTTP request.

It's like ordering a burger and getting the cow, the farm, and a documentary about agriculture.

## Why Nobody Cares (But Should)

Every unnecessary megabyte multiplies:
- Your import time × every developer × every day
- Your memory usage × every server × every deployment  
- Your complexity × every bug × every 3am debugging session

We normalized bloat. "Disk space is cheap." "RAM is cheap." Developer time isn't. User patience isn't. Server costs aren't.

## What Actually Works

Built my own version. Not because I'm smart. Because I was angry.

```
LiteCrew: 17MB (vs 208MB)
Import: 0.009s (vs 3.268s)
Dependencies: 12 (vs 175)
Works: Yes
Fedora issues: No
```

The secret? Only install what you use. Revolutionary concept.

## The Point

We're building infrastructure for the next decade. Every bad decision compounds. Today's "it works" is tomorrow's "why is everything so slow?"

In design, we learned this twenty years ago. Every pixel matters. Every millisecond counts. Every decision compounds.

AI development needs the same discipline. Not because it's elegant. Because the alternative is 551MB chatbots that take longer to import than to actually chat.

**Vector Wave**: Building AI that doesn't need its own data center to say hello. 

Performance is a feature. Restraint is a virtue. 551MB is a crime.
