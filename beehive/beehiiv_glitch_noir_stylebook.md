# AI Picked the Same TV Show. All Five of Them.

I generated 180 episodes of sci-fi TV, then asked AI to cosplay as streaming executives. They all picked the same show. The fedora problem was just the beginning.

---

## What Actually Happened

Built a noir sci-fi series. Ouroboros City. Time-loop megacity, cynical detective, algorithm murdering time. Standard cyberpunk fare.

Except I didn't write one version. I generated ten complete series:

- **"Memory Exchange"** - Trading memories like Bitcoin
- **"Meat and Code"** - Servers running on brain tissue  
- **"Revolution in the Loop"** - Eat the rich, temporally
- **"The Void Stares Back"** - Nothing matters, detective edition

180 episodes total. Each outlined, structured, ready to produce.

Traditional method: 6 months, 5 writers, 1 storyline.
My method: 1 week, 1 API, 10 storylines.

## The Executive Summit That Never Was

Instead of picking myself, I prompted AI to simulate streaming executives. Not generic ones. Specific people:

- Ted Sarandos (Netflix)
- Jennifer Salke (Amazon)
- Casey Bloys (HBO)
- Zack Van Amburg (Apple)

Fed it their public statements, platform strategies, known preferences. The simulation was uncomfortably accurate.

Casey Bloys: "Can AI content compete with Succession?"
Jennifer Salke: "Revolution in the Loop. It's The Boys meets Black Mirror."
Zack Van Amburg: "The meta-narrative in Meat and Code... ambitious."

They argued. HBO wanted prestige. Amazon wanted scale. Apple wanted innovation.

Then they all converged on **Memory Exchange**.

Casey Bloys: "I hate to admit it, but it's fucking brilliant. HBO could do this."

Final score: 95/100. Unanimous.

## The Algorithm Had Opinions Too

Built PRISM-X. Fancy name for basic math:
- Genre trends
- Market gaps
- Risk assessment (10,000 Monte Carlo runs)
- Viral potential scoring

The algorithm picked Memory Exchange. Score: 94/100.

Humans and machines agreed. That should have been my first warning.

## Then Production Started

### Checkpoint Reality
```
Plan: Generate promotional videos
Time: 48 hours
Result: Fedoras everywhere
Lessons: AI has fashion preferences
```

MiniMax video generator decided every detective needs a fedora. My prompts:
- "Cyberpunk 2087"
- "Tactical armor"
- "NO VINTAGE CLOTHING"
- "NO FUCKING FEDORA"

Results: Fedora in every shot.

Solution: Generate 3x more videos. Delete the ones with hats. Brute force beats elegance when AI likes vintage.

### Technical Reality Check

**Local Setup Attempt:**
- RTX 4070 Ti, 16GB VRAM
- LLaMA 2 for scripts
- Quality: High school drama club
- Cost: $0

**Cloud Reality:**
- Claude Opus 4 API
- Quality: Actually readable
- Cost: $0.19 per screenplay
- My ego: -$1000

Sometimes paying works.

### The Lip Sync Disaster

```
Attempt #1: Wav2Lip on stylized video → mouths floating
Attempt #2: Reduce glitch effects → looks like 1995
Attempt #3: Different AI entirely → $$$
```

Turns out lip sync needs real faces. Glitch noir aesthetics don't have real faces. Nobody mentions this in tutorials.

## Numbers Without Commentary

- Story variations: 10
- Episodes outlined: 180
- Videos generated: 63 (21 without fedoras)
- API cost: $0.19/screenplay
- Video generation cost: ~$200
- Fedora appearance rate: 67%
- My confidence this will work: 94%
- Actual chance this will work: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## What This Means

We can now explore every creative direction simultaneously. We can simulate audience reactions. We can make data-driven creative decisions.

We also get fedoras. So many fedoras.

The future isn't AI replacing writers. It's writers spending three days fighting with AI about period-appropriate headwear.

**Currently:** Building this anyway. The executives might be simulated but the invoice will be real.
