# Vector Wave Stylebook v2: No Clich√©s, No Bullshit

## Voice: Who's Writing This

Designer who ended up in VS Code wondering why. Twenty years of pixel-pushing, now debugging chatbots. Not a tech influencer, not a LinkedIn philosopher. Someone who actually has to maintain this shit in production.

## How to Write Without Sounding Like Every Other Tech Blog

### Instead of Universal Truths ‚Üí Specific Absurdities

‚ùå "AI often behaves unpredictably"
‚úÖ "AI insisted a detective in 2087 must wear a fedora. Every. Single. Generation."

### Instead of Story Time ‚Üí Dry Facts with Context

‚ùå "I was shocked to discover that..."
‚úÖ "551MB for a framework. Windows 95 was 40MB. Sit with that."

### Instead of Advice ‚Üí Observations

‚ùå "Always check your dependencies before installing!"
‚úÖ "Nobody checks dependencies. I don't either. That's why I now have 175 packages I don't need."

## Structure Without Formula

Not every post needs:
- Hook
- Story
- Lesson learned
- Inspirational closing

Sometimes it's just: problem ‚Üí attempted solution ‚Üí still broken ‚Üí the end.

## Language: What We Actually Do

### Comparisons from Life, Not the Internet

Instead of: "Like ordering a coffee and getting the entire Starbucks"
Better: "Like ordering a burger and getting the whole cow"

### Technical Details as Main Character

Don't hide numbers in narrative. Let them speak:
```
CrewAI: 551.5MB
My fork: 8.4MB
Does it work: no
```

### Frustration Without Performance

Instead of: "I couldn't believe my eyes!"
Better: "Checked three times. Still half a gig."

## Distinctive Elements (But Actually Ours)

### Checkpoint Reality

Not "narrator voice", just dry summary:
```
Plan: Quick fork, remove bloat
Time: One week
Result: 8MB of code that doesn't work
Lessons: [none]
```

### Failure Documentation

```
Attempt #1: Removed telemetry ‚Üí build failed
Attempt #2: Kept telemetry, removed UI ‚Üí build failed  
Attempt #3: Rewrote from scratch ‚Üí works but that's not a fork anymore
```

### Numbers That Hurt

Not as punchlines, as facts:
- Import time: 3.268s (coffee gets cold)
- Memory: 208MB (more than Photoshop in 2000)
- My patience: 0MB

## What We DON'T Do

### Meme Structures
- "Nobody: ... AI: [something random]"
- "So I did a thing"
- "A thread üßµ"
- "Let that sink in"

### Fake Relatability
- "We've all been there"
- "Is it just me or..."
- "Who else...?"

### Narrators and Voice-Overs
- Ron Howard, Morgan Freeman, David Attenborough
- "Meanwhile, in another universe"
- *record scratch* *freeze frame*

### Artificial Cliffhangers
- "But then something unexpected happened..."
- "Little did I know..."
- "What happened next will shock you"

## Tone: Between Rage and Fascination

Don't try to sound like:
- A stand-up comedian (you're not)
- A professor (boring)
- A Twitter personality (cringe)

Sound like:
- Someone who just lost 3 days to debugging
- But still wants to make it work
- Because the alternative is going back to building forms

## Endings That Aren't Motivational

Instead of: "The future belongs to builders who..."

Better:
- "551MB is too much. That's it."
- "It works. For now. Checking every hour."
- "If your framework weighs more than Windows 95, ask yourself some questions."

## Final Test

Read the text. If:
- You could paste it on LinkedIn unchanged ‚Üí wrong
- It would fit as a chapter in "Clean Code" ‚Üí wrong  
- It sounds like you explaining to your boss why the sprint is delayed ‚Üí right

## One Rule

Write like you're explaining a problem to a colleague over coffee. Not at standup. Not on LinkedIn. Over coffee, when everyone's gone home and you can say how it really is.

No beautification. No moral. With specifics that hurt.

"Fedora in cyberpunk. In 2087. AI has its priorities."
