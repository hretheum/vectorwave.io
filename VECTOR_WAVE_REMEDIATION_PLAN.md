## üéØ PRIORITY MATRIX

### **üî¥ PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL (BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION)**

#### **P1.1: Add Missing CrewAI Orchestrator Service** ‚ö° **CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: No dedicated CrewAI service (port 8042) in roadmap
- **Impact**: Complete user workflow will not function
- **Agent Finding**: "MAJOR GAP - brakuje konkretnej implementacji CrewAI integration"

#### **P1.2: Fix Port Allocation Conflict** ‚ö° **CRITICAL** 
- **Issue**: Editorial Service planned for 8084 (conflicts with Beehiiv Adapter)
- **Solution**: Change to port 8040 (as per target-version)
- **Impact**: Deployment failures without this fix

#### **P1.3: Split Mega-Tasks into Atomic Components** ‚ö° **CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: Tasks like 1.3.1 (16h) are not atomic
- **Impact**: Poor progress tracking, high failure risk
- **Agent Finding**: "Podziel na atomowe czƒô≈õci (max 4h ka≈ºda)"

### **üü° PRIORITY 2 - IMPORTANT (DURING IMPLEMENTATION)**

#### **P2.1: Add Comprehensive Test Definitions**
- **Issue**: Missing unit/integration test specifications per atomic task
- **Agent Finding**: QA Expert - "72/100 - brakuje strukturalnych test√≥w jednostkowych"

#### **P2.2: Add User Interface Specifications**
- **Issue**: Missing UI/UX definitions for complete user workflow
- **Impact**: Technical system without user experience layer

#### **P2.3: Enhanced Mock Detection Strategy**
- **Issue**: Risk of introducing hardcoded rules during implementation
- **Solution**: Automated detection mechanisms

### **üü¢ PRIORITY 3 - ENHANCEMENT (POST-IMPLEMENTATION)**

#### **P3.1: Production Monitoring Strategy**
- **Issue**: Basic monitoring only (60% coverage)
- **Enhancement**: Full observability stack

#### **P3.2: Performance Testing Framework**
- **Issue**: Limited performance test definitions
- **Enhancement**: Comprehensive load testing

        - "Start with wireframes and user approval"
        - "API-first development (UI can be added later)"
        - "Consider no-code/low-code solutions"
      contingency: "Launch with API-only, add UI in next iteration"

  low_risks:
    - risk_id: "R5"
      description: "Port allocation causing deployment issues"
      probability: "Low"
      impact: "Low"

### **Rollback Strategies per Risk**

```yaml
rollback_strategies:
  
  crewai_orchestrator_rollback:
    trigger: "CrewAI service fails to integrate within 1 week"
    steps:
      1: "Stop CrewAI Orchestrator service"
      2: "Revert to direct agent HTTP calls"
      3: "Update AI Writing Flow to use Editorial Service directly"
      4: "Skip checkpoint management features"
      5: "Continue with basic workflow functionality"
    recovery_time: "<2 hours"
    impact: "Medium - checkpoint features unavailable"
  
  atomization_rollback:
    trigger: "Atomic tasks taking longer than allocated time"
    steps:
      1: "Identify bottleneck atomic tasks"
      2: "Merge related atomic tasks into larger units"
      3: "Adjust timeline expectations"
      4: "Focus on critical path completion"
    recovery_time: "<30 minutes"
    impact: "Low - just timeline adjustment"
  
  ui_implementation_rollback:
    trigger: "User interface development blocking launch"
    steps:
      1: "De-prioritize UI tasks to post-launch"
      2: "Focus on API completeness"
      3: "Document API for future UI development"
      4: "Launch with API-only system"
    recovery_time: "<1 hour"  
    impact: "Medium - users need API knowledge initially"
