# Vector Waves Style Guide v1.0
## Part 1: Foundation & Voice

### 1.1 Mission & Anti-Mission

**OUR PURPOSE**  
"We decode technology's real impact through unflinching analysis, contrarian perspectives, and stories that matter to builders, not buzzword collectors."

**WHAT WE ALWAYS DO**
1. **Test Everything** - Every claim, every tool, every line of code
2. **Show Our Work** - Data sources, methodology, failures included  
3. **Respect Intelligence** - Write up, not down

**WHAT WE NEVER DO**
1. **Never publish untested code** (It's not a tutorial, it's a lie)
2. **Never use "revolutionary" without revolution** (Evolution is fine)
3. **Never hide corrections** (Mistakes get spotlight treatment)
4. **Never optimize for algorithms over humans** (Readers > Rankings)
5. **Never pretend neutrality** (Have opinions, show evidence)

**READER PROMISE**  
"Every piece earns your time by teaching something non-obvious, challenging assumptions, or saving you from mistakes we already made."

**SUNSET CLAUSE**  
"If we publish 3 consecutive months below 80% reader satisfaction or catch ourselves writing 'In today's fast-paced world,' we shut down."
