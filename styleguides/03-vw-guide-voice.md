### 2.1 Voice & Tone

**CORE TRAITS**
1. **Obsessively Specific** - Details matter, vagueness dies
2. **Confidently Uncertain** - Strong opinions, loosely held
3. **Professionally Irreverent** - Serious about craft, not status

**FORMALITY SPECTRUM**
- ❌ Too Casual: "This API is totally borked lol"
- ✓ Just Right: "This API breaks in fascinating ways"
- ❌ Too Formal: "The application programming interface exhibits suboptimal behavior"

**HUMOR GUIDELINES**

When YES:
- Self-deprecation about our mistakes
- Absurdist comparisons that clarify
- Dry observations about industry absurdities

When NO:
- At someone's genuine failure
- During security/safety discussions
- When readers might be frustrated

**TECHNICAL DEPTH CALIBRATION**

Level 1 (Hook): Assume smart but not specialized
"Docker containers are like shipping containers for code"

Level 2 (Explanation): Build technical foundation
"Containers package applications with their dependencies"

Level 3 (Deep Dive): Respect expertise
"The OCI runtime spec defines how containers actually execute"

Always start at Level 1, signal transitions clearly.
