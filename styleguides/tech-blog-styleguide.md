# Tech Blog Editorial Style Guide
## Million-Dollar Content Standards

### Core Philosophy
Write like you're explaining to a smart friend who happens to be less familiar with the topic. Balance technical accuracy with human authenticity. Every piece should educate, engage, and leave readers feeling smarter—not overwhelmed or patronized.

### Voice & Tone

#### What We Are
- **Conversationally Expert**: Write with authority but approachability
- **Specifically Enthusiastic**: Show genuine excitement with concrete examples
- **Intelligently Contrarian**: Challenge conventions with data, not attitude
- **Vulnerably Confident**: Share failures alongside successes

#### What We're Not
- Corporate robots spewing buzzwords
- Condescending explainers
- SEO-optimized content farms
- Generic thought leadership

### Language Standards

#### Vocabulary Guidelines
1. **Precision Over Pretension**
   - ❌ "leverage synergies" → ✅ "combine strengths"
   - ❌ "cutting-edge" → ✅ "released in 2024" or specific version
   - ❌ "seamless integration" → ✅ "connects automatically"

2. **Forbidden Phrases** (instant rejection)
   - "In today's fast-paced world"
   - "Game-changer"
   - "Delve into" (AI marker)
   - "Paradigm shift"
   - "Best practices" (without specifics)
   - "Revolutionary" (unless literally causing a revolution)

3. **Power Words** (use sparingly but effectively)
   - Specific numbers and metrics
   - Action verbs in present tense
   - Technical terms with immediate explanations
   - Emotional words backed by data

### Content Structure

#### The Hook (First 50 words)
- Start with intrigue, not throat-clearing
- Options:
  - Counterintuitive fact
  - Relatable problem
  - Provocative question
  - Personal anecdote
  - Surprising data point

#### The Journey
1. **Problem Definition** (Why should they care?)
2. **Context Building** (What's the landscape?)
3. **Solution Exploration** (How do we solve this?)
4. **Implementation Details** (What exactly do we do?)
5. **Results & Reflection** (What happened and what did we learn?)

#### The Payoff
- Concrete takeaways
- Next actions
- Open questions for exploration
- Community engagement prompt

### Technical Content Guidelines

#### Code Examples
- Every example must be tested and working
- Include context and prerequisites
- Show both happy path and edge cases
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Version information always included

#### Complexity Management
1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with the 80% use case
   - Layer in complexity
   - Clearly mark advanced sections
   - Provide escape hatches

2. **The Sandwich Method**
   - Plain language explanation
   - Technical terminology
   - Concrete example
   - Reinforcement

### Personality Injection Points

#### Where to Be Human
- Admitting mistakes and learning moments
- Sharing the messy middle of problem-solving
- Reacting to surprising discoveries
- Celebrating small wins
- Expressing genuine frustration (constructively)

#### Humor Guidelines
- Self-deprecation > Making fun of others
- Absurdist comparisons that illuminate
- Easter eggs in code comments
- Unexpected analogies
- Never force it—authentic or nothing

### Engagement Mechanics

#### Rhythm & Pacing
- Vary sentence length (5-word sentences. Then longer, more complex thoughts that explore nuance.)
- Break up text every 3-4 sentences
- Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- Create breathing room with:
  - Code blocks
  - Bullet points
  - Images/diagrams
  - Pull quotes

#### Visual Requirements
- Lead image that tells a story
- Diagrams for complex concepts
- Screenshots with annotations
- Code syntax highlighting
- Progress indicators for long reads

### Topic Selection Criteria

#### Green Light Topics
- Problems you've personally solved
- Contrarian takes backed by experience
- Deep dives into overlooked tools
- Post-mortems with lessons
- Future predictions with reasoning
- Cross-domain applications

#### Red Light Topics
- Anything you haven't actually done
- Pure theory without practice
- Regurgitated documentation
- "X vs Y" without clear recommendation
- Listicles without depth
- SEO-bait trend chasing

### Quality Checkpoints

#### Pre-Publication Checklist
- [ ] Would I send this to a respected peer?
- [ ] Does it teach something non-obvious?
- [ ] Are all code examples tested?
- [ ] Is the personality authentic, not performative?
- [ ] Does it respect reader intelligence?
- [ ] Have I killed all darlings (unnecessary clever bits)?
- [ ] Is the value front-loaded?
- [ ] Would I read this if I wasn't paid to?

### Metrics That Matter

#### Engagement Indicators
- Time on page (aim for 70%+ of estimated read time)
- Scroll depth (80%+ completion)
- Comments with technical substance
- Social shares with personal commentary
- Return visitor rate
- Newsletter subscriptions from post

#### Vanity Metrics to Ignore
- Raw pageviews without engagement
- Generic social shares
- "Great post!" comments
- SEO rankings for generic terms

### Editorial Red Flags

#### Immediate Revision Triggers
- Three sentences in a row starting the same way
- Paragraph with no concrete example
- Technical term without context
- Hedge words appearing 3+ times ("perhaps," "maybe," "might")
- Any sentence you'd be embarrassed to read aloud

### The Ultimate Test
Before publishing, ask:
> "Would this post make someone excited to try what I'm describing, or would it make them feel stupid for not already knowing it?"

If it's the latter, rewrite until it's the former.
