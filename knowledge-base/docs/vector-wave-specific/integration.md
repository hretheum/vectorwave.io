## Integration Example

```python
from vector_wave import KnowledgeBaseTool
from crewai import Agent

kb_tool = KnowledgeBaseTool(
    api_endpoint="http://localhost:8082/api/v1/knowledge"
)

knowledge_agent = Agent(
    role='Knowledge Specialist',
    goal='Provide accurate information from the knowledge base',
    tools=[kb_tool],
    backstory='You have access to comprehensive CrewAI documentation'
)
```
