## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Complete Phase 3 Architecture
```
Monitoring & Validation Stack:
├── Monitoring System (~2,900 lines)
│   ├── flow_metrics.py          - 698 lines (KPI tracking + observer)
│   ├── dashboard_api.py         - 650 lines (time-series + health)
│   ├── alerting.py              - 650 lines (multi-channel + escalation)
│   └── storage.py               - 900 lines (SQLite + file + retention)
├── Validation System (~500 lines)
│   └── quality_gate.py          - 5 validation rules (static + runtime)
├── Testing Suite (227 tests)
│   ├── Unit Tests               - 99 tests (100% coverage)
│   ├── Integration Tests        - 58 tests

```

### Key Implementation Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: FlowMetrics ↔ AlertManager integration
- **Multi-Backend Storage**: SQLite primary, file fallback with retention
- **Quality Gates**: 5 validation rules (circular deps, loops, performance, coverage, architecture)
- **Thread-Safe Monitoring**: RLock protection for concurrent access
- **Real-Time Alerting**: Console, webhook, email channels with escalation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 227 tests covering all components + monitoring
