            4. ✅ Apply validation suggestions to improve quality
            5. 🎯 Re-validate if significant changes were made
            
            Content Requirements:
            1. Start with an irresistible hook using generate_hook tool
            2. Structure content for {platform} format using structure_content tool
            3. Include 3+ non-obvious insights using extract_insights tool
            4. Back every claim with evidence
            5. Use concrete examples and stories
            6. End with clear next steps
            7. Validate with Editorial Service selective validation throughout process
            
            Editorial Service Integration:
            - Service: {self.editorial_service_url}
            - Mode: Selective validation (3-4 critical rules for human-assisted workflow)
            - Checkpoint: "writing" (focuses on content quality, not final polish)
            - All validation rules sourced from ChromaDB (zero hardcoded)
            
            Style Guidelines (validated by Editorial Service):
            - No corporate jargon or buzzwords
            - Active voice, direct statements
            - Contrarian but not controversial
            - Data-driven but human
            - Specific > Generic always

            Important: Use Editorial Service validation at key checkpoints during writing.
