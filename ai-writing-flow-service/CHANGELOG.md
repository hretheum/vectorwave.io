### ðŸŽ‰ PHASE 2 COMPLETE - Linear Flow Implementation

#### Added
- **LinearExecutionChain**
- Replaced router/listen patterns with linear execution

  - `quality_linear.py` - Quality assessment with gates and auto-approval

- **Flow Path Configuration**
  - Dynamic path optimization based on content type and platform
  - Platform-specific settings (Twitter faster, LinkedIn quality)
  - Content ownership paths (ORIGINAL vs EXTERNAL)
  - Configurable retry limits per stage

- **Comprehensive Execution Guards**
  - Resource monitoring (CPU/Memory with thresholds)
  - Execution time limits (5min/method, 30min/flow)
  - Method frequency protection
  - Integration with loop prevention system
  - Emergency stop functionality
