# AI Writing Flow - Commit Message Template
#
# Type: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore
# Scope: agents|flow|kb|tools|monitoring|optimization|config|ui
#
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Example: feat(agents): add research capabilities to ContentAgent
#
# Subject line: 50 chars max, imperative mood
# Body: 72 chars per line, explain what and why


# Type guidelines:
# - feat: new feature for the user
# - fix: bug fix for the user
# - docs: documentation only changes
# - style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc
# - refactor: refactoring production code
# - test: adding tests, refactoring tests
# - chore: updating grunt tasks, dependencies, etc

# Remember:
# - Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
# - Don't end subject with period
# - Separate subject from body with blank line
# - Use body to explain what and why vs. how
